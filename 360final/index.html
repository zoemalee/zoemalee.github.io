                […] Politically engaged art is often dystopian. When we’re surrounded by 
                artistic dystopias, a part of us starts getting used to it, and expecting it. 
            </h5>

            <h5>
                Dystopian art reflects our madness and problematic narratives back to us; it 
                draws attention to injustices we may be ignoring.

            <h5>
                But we need narratives of 
                hope so we know what to ask for. We can only want what we can imagine.

            I’m tackling this problem; I’m in this conversation; I’m building this thing. 
            Early on, I knew that there were all these forces in the world, but I have picked 
            one, and I’m on the team, and I’m just going to row. I know what my team is, and 
            I just fucking row.

            You said I believe we are better. I’m trying to contact that within people, 
            because it’s always there. In Buddhism, it’s the part that becomes enlightened, 
            and that leads you to enlightenment. I really believe in that.

        <p class="jost textmargin">
            Where is that capacity? I think glimmers of it gather around a few places inside us. 
            One of those places is our ability to feel wonder, and another is our ability to feel 
            compassion. Even in the face of the worst.I know sometimes that a more cynical 
            approach would be perhaps more acceptable in the art world (and that is how I make 
            my living). But choosing hope allows me to be in touch with myself and to not take 
            a posture.The other thing is: then you find your team. There are a lot of people who 
            also want to choose humanity, compassion, hope.

            Last question. There’s a common criticism that artists don’t get out into the 
            world enough, or if they do, they stay locked in a sort of arts-focused circle. 
            What is your advice to artists who may feel locked away in their studios?
