        <h2>BIO</h2>
        <p>Hi everybody…
            My name is Zoe, I am a Graphic Design student at Western Washington University in Bellingham. 
            I enjoy illustration, packaging design, and motion design, anything that lets me get a little artsy. 
            Since most of my work-life is stuck behind a computer, any opportunity I get to make analog art, 
            I AM THERE. Drawing, painting, linocut, crochet, collage…you name it, I probably want to learn it. 
            When I’m not glued to my computer or scribbling nonsense into my sketchbook, I love to ski, mountain 
            bike, and spend time outside. I love working with my hands.
            
            Since we have just transitioned into the new year and resolution mojo is high, I’ll share a couple 
            of my 2022 Ins and Outs:
            
            In:
